This is a collection of laser cutting files I have designed and/or have come across online. Some of these are a work in progress (WIP). 

ment to be cut with a laser as:
1.  single layer cordura and sewn traditionally with hem (MICC)
2.  Laminate fabric and top stiched or intigrated into cordura (LMICC)


Feel free to make and addtions/modifacations as you want.

I use a combonation of autocad and inkscape to make these.

the current file formats are: 

    autocad - .dxf .dwg
    inkscape - .svg .pdf
